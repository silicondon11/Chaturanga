# Levels

I've begun conducting individual in-depth research on the first 10 battles listed. The following is a list of the battles that I have finalized and briefly researched to obtain some basic information. This helps get a picture of the difficulty in obtaining victory and determines each battle's place in the order of levels. 

The first 30 levels have been finalized, as well as 4 battles for online mode, chosen for being particularly even-sided. Additionally, 20 more levels will make up levels 30-50 (order not yet decided).

| Level  | Battle Name          | Battle Type          | Heroes               | Enemy                   | User           | Year         | Location                             | Difficulty | Playability | Uniqueness | Squads                                                                                                                                      |
